This is my Final Project for Harvard CS50, it's an interactive Web Application built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask and SQL.
My Project is titled Apollo Finance, it's a personal/business finance that helps users keep track of the income(sales) and expenses(purchases) of their personal or business account. It allows the user to set and delete tasks, perform common business math calculations and see a history of all their transactions.
